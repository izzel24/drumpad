# Drum Machine - Project for FreeCodeCamp Certification ðŸŽ“

This project was built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Certification program to demonstrate my understanding of frontend frameworks, focusing on:

- **Component-based architecture** using React
- **Handling user input** via mouse clicks and keyboard events
- **Audio playback** for a seamless drum-playing experience

## Live Demo ðŸš€
Check out the live demo of the project here: [Drum Machine](https://izzel24.github.io/Drum-Machine/)

## How It Works ðŸ”§
1. **Interactive Keys**: Users can play drum sounds by clicking the buttons or pressing the corresponding keys (**Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C**).
2. **Real-time Audio Feedback**: When a drum pad is activated, the corresponding sound is played, and the display shows the name of the sound.
3. **Keyboard Support**: The application listens for keypress events using React's `useEffect` to provide a more dynamic interaction.
